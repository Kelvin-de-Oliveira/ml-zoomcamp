# Machine Learning Zoomcamp Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the homework and project exercises from the course  
[**Machine Learning Zoomcamp: A Free 4-Month Course on ML Engineering**](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp),  
offered for free by the team at [DataTalksClub](https://datatalks.club/).  

Feel free to explore and find more information about each section/exercise in its corresponding folder.  

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by course modules, with a separate folder for each module:
```
ML-Zoomcamp-Solutions/
│
├── Module-01/
│   ├── notebooks/
│   └── data/
│
├── Module-02/
│   ├── notebooks/
│   └── data/

```

- Each `Module` folder contains the exercises and projects for that specific part of the course.
